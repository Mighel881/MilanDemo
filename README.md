# MilanDemo

This project was originally created by Guilherme Rambo under the name  [CheckMarkDemo](https://github.com/insidegui/CheckmarkDemo), I'd been interested in experimenting with the Core Animation Markup Language since reestablishing my interest in iOS after a long hiatus. I've updated the project to include an example that I feel can dignify just how powerful this language really is. No private frameworks are linked, the code generation of CALayer is even [documented](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer?language=objc)

The animation is set at an infinite loop

you can follow me on twitter @insan1d if you'd like, if you're interested in how this was done you can feel free to ask away
